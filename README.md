# Miguapa-Mundi
An ecommerce of the world, but it's not a game, would you believe it?

Miguapa Mundi is a web store that simulates the purchase and selling of countries. The platform will allow users to participate in an interactive experience where they can buy countries, make offers, manage the countries they own, interact with global events and customize their experience by creating alliances and designing flags for their countries.

All the information related to the documentation, standards for the project's development and its installation can be found in the [wiki of the project](https://github.com/juanfepi27/Miguapa-Mundi/wiki)
